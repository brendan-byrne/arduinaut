## Arduinaut -Arduino IDE Theme ##
**About**<br />
Arduinaut is a custom theme for the Arduino programming environment. It is based upon Argonaut by Pawe≈Ç Waleczek which can be found here [https://github.com/pwaleczek/Argonaut-theme](https://github.com/pwaleczek/Argonaut-theme)

**Installation**<br />
Replace the `theme` folder found inside `../arduino/lib` with the one from this repo. Make a copy of the original if you'd like to revert later. 

The `theme` folder contains a text tile (`theme.txt`) which contains the color information. Buttons and tabs are included as image files.
